<!-- Notes for below similarities to my Vanilla blueprint: 
    world-map-container = svg_content   Will apply those setting here. the difference being an extra div inside to bring in country id. 
    potential issue if doesn't work, the former mat-grid-list..See if the SVG components really on that, change to what's needed to work here.
    We'll have to change some stuff in input form to bring in info from API. Likely do this in the country-details component.

        <!-- RIch Fix it area. This method is what I'm trying to contain. 
            I assume let country of countries is the right use. 
            I also think as I'm doing my project, that this For and If ng containers will go in my Searchcomponent, or maybe I bring the search component here instead with the country details.

        <ng-container *ngFor="let country of countries">
            <div class="search-data" *ngIf="searchText === '' || country.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchText) ">
